## What is this?

We broke down 2,000 years of Silk Road history into a structured knowledge graph. Every city, figure, trade good, and historical event is connected — and you can explore all of it interactively.

**🗺️ Interactive Map** — 74 cities on real geographic coordinates across Eurasia, the Indian Ocean, and East Africa

**🕸️ Relationship Graph** — D3.js force-directed graph with 568 edges. Drag nodes, discover hidden connections

**⏳ Dynasty Timeline** — Filter by dynasty (Han → Tang → Yuan → Ming). Map and data sync instantly

**🎬 8 Animated Trade Routes** — Watch silk, paper, gunpowder, Buddhism, and tea travel across the map as golden pulse dots with voice narration

**📖 21 Interactive Stories** — Follow 21 travelers chapter by chapter. The map flies to each location as the story unfolds. A few examples:

## Tech Stack

- **Data:** Single JSON file (43 KB) — the single source of truth
- **Frontend:** Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS — zero frameworks
- **Map:** [Leaflet.js](https://leafletjs.com/) + CartoDB dark tiles
- **Graph:** [D3.js v7](https://d3js.org/) force simulation
- **Animation:** Canvas + requestAnimationFrame
- **Deployment:** GitHub Pages — push to deploy, zero hosting cost

## Why this approach?

**Single data source → Multiple content forms.** Add one city to the JSON, and it instantly appears on the map, in the relationship graph, on the timeline, in the knowledge cards, and in the API output. No duplication, no drift.
